## AnimatedConverters is a plugin for KSP mod development. It is a part of the AT_Utils framework.

It provides several part modules for resource conversion that use [MultiAnimators](https://github.com/allista/MultiAnimators) to animate the process. They are also mandatory-mass-conserving converters.
